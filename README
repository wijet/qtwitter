qTwitter is an application interacting with Twitter and Identi.ca social networks. Aims to be as compact as possible still providing outstanding usability. Since it's a Qt-based application with no other dependencies, it works wherever Qt does, i.e. Windows, Mac OS X and vast variety of Linuxes and Unices supporting X11 (including Nokia's Maemo platform).

Features' summary as for v0.7.1:
  - support for Twitter and Identi.ca for:
    * friends and public timeline,
    * posting, replying, retweeting, deleting and (dis)favoring statuses,
    * downloading, sending and deleting direct messages,
  - support for working with multiple accounts at the same time,
  - integrated support for one-click URL shortening via 8 different services,
  - full interaction with TwitPic API, allowing for easy one-click image uploading and posting updates,
  - system tray notifications (via knotify and Growl),
  - customizable statuses list length and look (via the use of themes),
  - in-session passwords storing (can be disabled),
  - HTTP proxy support,
  - being recognized as a source of updates,
  - translation to 8 languages in the run-time (sorry for my poor Catalan, I appreciate any help here :) ).
